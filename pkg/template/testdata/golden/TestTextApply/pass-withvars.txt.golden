Here is an example of oohhhh snap! values in a file.


https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24963

For a template option of `missingkey=zero`, a nil value will have a `<no value>`
replacement text.  Similar to the comments made in the ticket, I think this is
odd as the value has now been turned into a string anyways, so turning it into
"" probably would have made more sense.
